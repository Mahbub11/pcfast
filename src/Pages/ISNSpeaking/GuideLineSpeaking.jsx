              Usually, there are two or three questions within each speaking
              prompt, so try to answer the prompts completely. Extend your
              responses by providing examples and/or explanations for your
              ideas. Short answers indicate to Duolingo that you are unable to
              discuss a topic in depth. <br></br> Practice common Duolingo
