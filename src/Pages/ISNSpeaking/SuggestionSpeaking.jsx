              Many individuals recommend reading books, magazines, and
              television shows to learn new words. <br></br> <br></br>
              However, it's equally crucial to look up any academic words you're
              unsure of. Many people disregard challenging and uncommon
              terminology because they think they won't be used in their daily
              lives or on exams.<br></br> <br></br>
              However, make it a habit to look up unusual vocabulary words,
              especially if they are challenging for you to read, write, or
              spell.<br></br> <br></br>

              It can sound a little cliche to keep a notepad to write down any
              new academic phrases and their explanations. However, it might
              help you understand those terms more clearly. <br></br>
              <br></br>
              When the test is coming, you can also use the book to study the
              printed words. That is a much better option than frantically
              looking up new terms the night before the test.
